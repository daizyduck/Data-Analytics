# Basic python: Logistic Regression with Python
Code of the tutorial [Python Basics: Logistic regression with Python]

The Logistic Regression belongs to Supervised learning algorithms that predict the categorical dependent output variable using a given set of independent input variables. This article will cover Logistic Regression, its implementation, and performance evaluation using Python. We will be using AWS SageMaker Studio and Jupyter Notebook for model implementation and visualization purposes.

Logistic Regression is very similar to Linear Regression but instead of solving regression problems, it is used to solve classification purposes. In Logistic Regression, we’re using an S-shaped logistic function (sigmoid) instead of using a simple regression function. In the upcoming sections, we cover the mathematical calculations behind Logistic Regression that will help us distinguish it from Linear Regression.
