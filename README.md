# Basic python: Logistic Regression with Python
Code of the tutorial [Python Basics: Logistic regression with Python]

1. Introduction to Logistic Regression
When data scientists may come across a new classification problem, the first algorithm that may come across their mind is Logistic Regression. It is a supervised learning classification algorithm which is used to predict observations to a discrete set of classes. Practically, it is used to classify observations into different categories. Hence, its output is discrete in nature. Logistic Regression is also called Logit Regression. It is one of the most simple, straightforward and versatile classification algorithms which is used to solve classification problems.

People who are new to machine learning may get confused with the Logistic Regression name. They tend to think that it is a regression algorithm. But, this is not true. Logistic Regression is the classification algorithm and it is used for supervised learning classification problems.

So, I will start the discussion by comparing differences between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

2. Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression
In this section, I will elaborate the differences between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. The differences are listed below:-

Linear regression is used to predict continuous outputs whereas Logistic Regression is used to predict discrete set of outputs which is mapped to different classes.

So, the examples of Linear Regression are predicting the house prices and stock prices. The examples of Logistic Regression include predicting whether a student will fail or pass and whether a patient will survive or not after a major operation.

Linear Regression is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation whereas Logistic Regression is based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach.
